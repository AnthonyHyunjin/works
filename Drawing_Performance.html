    <p>The egg beater is drafted in four elevations and sections as one piece as well as another four sections as separated parts. Towards the middle of the piece, there are multiple elevations of the bottom (whisk) that is represented in a disorderly manner. The eight drafts of the egg beater is in a circular formation around the bottom whisk elevations (some of them overlapping) to resemble a bowl that is needed to contain the ingredients that the tool is needed to perform its task. The movement of the tool is more chaotic than orderly, noting the various arrays of elevations in the middle of the draft.</p></div>

<div class="motiondescription">
    <p>The focus for this draft is the circular, non-linear path of the overall tool and the rotational motion of the whisks in the egg beater. The elevation drafts of the bottom of the tool is nearly identical to the smaller elevations in the object drawing; however, the circles tangent to the whisk and the many repetitions of the whisks itself in a lighter line weight gives its rotational motion. The rest of the draft is covered by a path of smaller circles to symbolize the motion of the handle along with bigger circles that show the wheel. Not only do the motion path go through the large elevations to add an overall inclusiveness to the draft but abstracted side elevations of the egg beater is drafted in various directions throughout the draft to show its non-linearlity of its use.</p></div>

    <p>Creating construction lines with accurate line weights give a simple but equally visualizing representation of the outline of the model; however, it is impossible to see how the tectonic constructions are put together from a computer. Therefore, much of the design process is heavily accented on model-making using various materials.</p>
    &nbsp;
    <p>As the project nears the deadline, a major decision has to be made in replicating the thickness of the poplar material to be used in the final project. Because of that, the chipboard and corrugated cardboard materials are abandoned and scrap wood and foam core are emphasized in the later models to create a realistic replica of the final design.</p></div>

    <p>drawing performance model</p></div>
    &nbsp;
<div class="ddescription">
    <p>The overall premise of this drawing performance is express the motion of two tools while revealing a tectonic construction system. This project combines the verbs and actions of both the egg beater and the potato peeler.</p>
    &nbsp;
    <p>The first half of the model shows the consistent and perpendicular layering of thin planes to symbolize the end result (the skin) of the peeler.  As the model transitions towards the middle and into the second part, the vertical planes begin to curve into “C” shapes. The curves are places purposefully in a disorganized chaotic manner to show the whimsical direction the egg beater takes. The end result is a separate but smooth connection between the tools with slits through the base some linear, some curved) to represent both the tool’s digging purposes.</p>
    &nbsp;
    <p>The construction of these pieces were done using the table saw, bandsaw, mill, hollowed chisel mortiser and the router. The joints used mainly involves many perpendicular slits that piece together by sliding them in. The purpose of building a wooden model is to show how the tectonic construction systems can be cut and made with the tools given.</p></div>
